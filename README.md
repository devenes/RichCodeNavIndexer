[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/microsoft/RichCodeNavIndexer/workflows/CI/PR/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/RichCodeNavIndexer/actions)

This action indexes the repo it runs within and uploads the language service data to the Rich Code Nav service.

**Pre-requisite:
You must [sign-up](https://aka.ms/richnavigation) and be approved for Rich Code Navigation Private Preview prior to installing this GitHub Action.**

## Example usage

```yaml
- uses: microsoft/RichCodeNavIndexer@v0.1
  with:
    repo-token: ${{ github.token }}
```
